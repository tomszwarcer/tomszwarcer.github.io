## Dark Matter Summer Placement
#### 2024

- Eight-week internship with the [MIGDAL collaboration](https://migdal.pp.rl.ac.uk/) at [STFC](https://www.ukri.org/councils/stfc/), working towards the observation and measurement of the Migdal effect, an effect which could make existing dark matter detectors sensitive to a wider mass range.
- Investigation done into the use of Magboltz to track the production of scintillation light in CF4/Ar mixtures, in the GEM geometry and E-field present in the MIGDAL time projection chamber
- Proof of concept system for tracking the production of scintillation light in Garfield++/Magboltz was developed.
- Methods for reducing computation time of GEM drift simulations were investigated
- Gained experience working with gas detectors, including the operational principles of time projection chambers and GEMs
- Progress regularly presented to the collaboration. Student seminar presentation given to other researchers and summer students. Project report assembled.

## Third year project
#### 2024

- Extended astrophysics practical project. By fitting isochrones to processed data from observational images, the age, distance, and extinction parameters for stellar clusters were obtained.
- Developed ability to quickly understand and use specialised scientific software and tools (QFitsView, SAOImageDS9, TOPCAT)
- Literature search carried out. Results presented in a scientific report, which scored 85

- Report can be viewed [here](/assets/Mini_Project_Report_T_Szwarcer.pdf)
