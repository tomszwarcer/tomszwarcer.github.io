## Dark Matter Summer Placement
#### 2024

- Eight-week internship with the [MIGDAL collaboration](https://migdal.pp.rl.ac.uk/) at [STFC](https://www.ukri.org/councils/stfc/), working towards the observation and measurement of the Migdal effect. This effect could make experiments that detect dark matter candidates sensitive to a wider mass range.
-  Investigation done into the use of Garfield++ and Magboltz for tracking the production of scintillation light in CF4/Ar mixtures.
- Application to the GEM geometry and E-field configuration present in the MIGDAL time projection chamber.
- Proof of concept system for tracking the production of scintillation light was developed.
- Methods for reducing computation time of GEM drift simulations were investigated
- Gained experience working with gas detectors, including the operational principles of time projection chambers and GEMs
- Progress regularly presented to the collaboration. Seminar presentation given to researchers and other summer students. Project report assembled.

- Project report can be found [here](/assets/MIGDAL_Report_final.pdf)
- Code can be found [here](https://github.com/tomszwarcer/gemsim)
- Presentation slides can be found [here](/assets/seminar_slides.pdf)

## Third year project
#### 2024

- Extended astrophysics practical project. 
- Data reduction and photometry was done on observational images. 
- Membership to clusters was confirmed by matching proper motion and parallax data from the Gaia satellate to our processed data using TOPCAT. 
- Colour magnitude diagrams were produced from the processed data, and isochrones fitted to them. Age, distance and extinction parameters, with estimated errors, were obtained. 
- Literature search carried out to test agreement of results
- Developed ability to quickly understand and use specialised scientific software and tools (QFitsView, SAOImageDS9, TOPCAT)
- Results presented in a scientific report, which scored 85

- Report can be viewed [here](/assets/Mini_Project_Report_T_Szwarcer.pdf)
